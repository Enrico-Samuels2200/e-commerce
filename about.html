        <h1>Our ultimate goal</h1>
        <p>Our companies main goal is to re-create the world as we know to something<br />
            far better. The world we know today is very tech driven, but new tech comes at<br />
            an expensive price. Our company sells the latest tech at a much cheaper price.<br />
            This will boost communication between companies and individuals too.<br />
            In turn this enables our economy to grow faster,therefor we can move foward and<br />
            tackle real world problems. This will ultimately create a better future, if individuals<br />
            can work together as a team and face the problems at hand.
